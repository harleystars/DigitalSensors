Just create in your Arduino projects folder - folder with name "digitalsensorsUSB_BT". Put file digitalsensorsUSB_BT.ino into this folder and open with Arduino IDE. 
Here are source code that can be uploaded to Arduino Nano board via Arduino IDE. I`ve used Arduino IDE version 1.8.x. 
Can`t work at the moment on Android with OS version 14 devices.
